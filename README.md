## Final Project

<!-- Original Goals -->
### Original Goals
Team 10’s project focuses on the integration of a gimbaled OAK-D Lite to the basic MAE/ECE 148 robot car platform. This would enable a source of vision that is independent of the car’s chassis or direction of travel. Furthermore, we also wanted to compare the computer vision detection options between RGB video, RBG video w/ depth perception (RGB-D), ArUco Markers/AprilTags, and a combination of these three.
   
<!-- End Results -->
### Goals We Met
<p>
  The gps was setup inside the donkey environment, which is outside of ROS2(docker container). We struggled to make ROS2 communicate with the gps outside of the docker environment especially doing rerouting of the gps lap when a pedestrian is detected. Therefore, we decidced to make gps works inside ROS2 instead of in the donkey environment, and this has become our top priority since it would be a lot easier to use for the future classes. To do so, we figured the general workflow of the packages and nodes provided inside docker contianer, and we ended up pulling the original github repository from <a href="https://gitlab.com/ucsd_robocar2/ucsd_robocar_hub2">ucsd_robocar_hub2</a> to get necessary nodes. We found that it was missing the node of reading from gps, so we implemented the node for ublox gps from scratch called "ublox_gps_node.py" under the directory ucsd_robocar_hub2/ucsd_robocar_sensor2_pkg/ucsd_robocar_sensor2_pkg/. We did a series of testing of the gps node to work with the existing files for the robot to follow gps coordinates. The overall workflow detail will be discussed in the Final Project Documentation sectoion.
</p>

<p>
  On the camera side, we self trained a model on roboflow to detect pedestrian by detecting any "foot" appearing in front of the oakd camera. This would be easier for camera to see if there is any people right in front of the camera instead of looking from a long distance to record a whole person. We created a package in ROS2 for the camera called "oakd_node.py" under ucsd_robocar_hub2/oakd_ros2/oakd_ros2/ to send detection message of "left", "right", or "none" to indicate which direction the pedestrian is moving, so the robocar can change its route accordingly. The picture below shows an example of the detection message being sent(also included in the presentation slides).

</p>
<p>
  At the end, we didn't show the completed demo of robot car avoiding pedestrian while following the lap, but we have every parts(camera and gps) completed separately.
</p>


### If We Have Another Week...
#### Goal 1
Unfortunately we couldn't finish combining every part together for the robot car to avoid pedestrian while following the GPS path as we promised originally, but we have the GPS node and camera node completed in ROS2, we just need to make some changes to "gps_path_provider_node.py" under ucsd_robocar_hub2/ucsd_robocar_path2_pkg/ucsd_robocar_path2_pkg
/ to activate conditions of path re-routing based on the "oakd_node.py" which publishes the detection data, so the robot car can turn either left or right and then go back into the original path, we would need to have a separate PID for this as well.

<!-- We want to have chatgpt's path following trigger the manage.py drive command automatically so that chatgpt can navigate fully autonomous. We also want to have chatgpt only use one model instead of two seperated models. Finally, we want to turn the lidar data into a SLAM map and feed chatgpt an image map of its surroundings to generate better maps. -->

#### Goal 2
We would like to implement self parking using lidar and computer vision so the robot car can correct itself based on the space lines using the camera.
<!--We want automatic lidar stopping to be implemented for safety. Since chatgpt does not control the robot in real time, we need a way for the robot to stop if it is about to hit an object or person.-->

### Robot Design CAD
<!--<img src="/media/full%20car%20cad.png" width="400" height="300" />-->

#### Open Source Parts
| Part | CAD Model | Source |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Jetson Nano Case | <img src="jetsonCAD.png" /> | [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3532828) |

### Software

#### Embedded Systems
The system is running based on jetson nano and oakd-lite camera. 
<!--To run the system, we used a Jetson Nano with an Oakd depth camera, an ld06 lidar sensor, and a point one Fusion Engine gps. For motion we used a VESC Driver within the Donkey Car framework. https://www.donkeycar.com/-->

#### ROS2
<p>
In this section we will specifically show the steps to set-up GPS in ROS2.
</p>
<p>
  To get started, click into /ucsd_robocar_hub2 folder and you can see a lot of packages listed. Below is the main flow of the nodes interect with each other when we tested the gps:

### How to Run
Use the UCSD Robocar Docker images. Python3 is required, you might need to install other dependencies if needed.

Step 1: Once you setup your docker container, open a terminal, go into the docker container.

```docker start name_of_your_container```

```docker exec -it name_of_your_container bash```

```source_ros2```

Clone this repository into ros2_ws.

```git clone https://github.com/UCSD-ECEMAE-148/148-winter-2025-final-project-team-2.git```

```build_ros2```

Step 2: Then, you can have a quick start to run the robot car at the EBU courtyard!

Since this is an extension of the github repository from <a href="https://gitlab.com/ucsd_robocar2/ucsd_robocar_hub2">ucsd_robocar_hub2</a>, the default path file on the repository is a small circle inside the courtyard of EBU building. 
This is the image showing the default path being used:

 <img src="EBUcourtyard.png" >
 
To start your robot car to follow the path, simply run:

```ros2 launch ucsd_robocar_nav2_pkg all_nodes.launch.py```


Step 3: If you would like to change the gps lap for your robot car to run on, you can put your recorded .csv file inside /home/projects/ros2_ws/ebu2_courtyard/ebu2_courtyard_man_2.csv

```cd /home/projects/ros2_ws/ebu2_courtyard```

Copy paste your own file here:

```nano ebu2_courtyard_man_2.csv```

### Notice that your .csv file has to have the format of "lat,lon,alt" as the column name, for example:
<p>
lat,    lon,     alt
</p>
<p>
37.7749,-122.4194,30.0
</p>
<p>
34.0522,-118.2437,100.5
</p>
<p>
40.7128,-74.0060,50.2
</p>


Step 5: Finally, to get the car running on your custom path:

```source_ros2```

```build_ros2```

```ros2 launch ucsd_robocar_nav2_pkg all_nodes.launch.py ```
